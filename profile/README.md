## ChistaDATA ðŸ‘‹

### Introduction

ChistaDATA Inc. is a leading vendor of 24*7 consultative enterprise-class support, end-to-end managed services, bespoke production engineering, and [cloud services](chistadata.io) for ClickHouse, the world's fastest (and open source) real-time analytics database management system.

### Our Work

Over the last few years, ChistaDATA has delivered enterprise-class support for hundreds of petabytes of data for some of the world's largest enterprises ([see the list here](https://chistadata.com/)). We maintain custom builds of ClickHouse developed specifically for customer use cases, i.e., forks of the community ClickHouse with community approved patches. We also author open source software tooling around ClickHouse such as the [Anansi Query Profiler](https://chistadata.com/chistadata-anansi-query-profiler-for-clickhouse/), the [Asabru Proxy](https://docs.cloud.chistadata.io/getting-started/asabru-proxy/index.html), etc. All of our software tooling is GPL-licensed and freely available to all community members, forever.

### Our Blog

We also blog actively about ClickHouse internals, with ~500 articles in total available at our [blog](chistadata.com/blog) and [knowledge base](https://chistadata.com/knowledge-base/).
